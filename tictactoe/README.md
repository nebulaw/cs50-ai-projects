# Tic Tac Toe AI

This project implements the minimax algorithm. The AI can play as either X or O and will always make the optimal move to either win or force a draw.

## Files

- `tictactoe.py`: Contains the logic for the Tic Tac Toe game and the minimax algorithm.
- `runner.py`: Contains the Pygame code to run the graphical interface for the game.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
2. Run the `runner.py` script to start the game.

```bash
# if you have bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python runner.py
```
